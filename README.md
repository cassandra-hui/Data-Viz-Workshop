# Data Visualization with R

## Visualizing Data with R: From Basics to Publication-Ready Graphics

A comprehensive workshop on data visualization using R, developed by the Nevada Bioinformatics Center.

### Workshop Overview

This workshop guides participants through the process of creating effective, publication-quality data visualizations in R using the ggplot2 package. The material is structured in three progressive modules, taking participants from basic concepts to advanced visualization techniques.

### Workshop Structure

#### Part 1: Foundations of Data Visualization
- Understanding data types
- Crafting an effective data story
- Introduction to R for visualization
- Long vs wide data formats
- Introduction to ggplot2
- Basic plot customization

#### Part 2: Intermediate Data Visualization
- Data summarization techniques
- Plotting raw data
- Customizing figures with themes, shapes, colors, and labels
- Creating bubble plots
- Practical exercises

#### Part 3: Advanced Data Visualization
- Combining multiple plots
- Showing statistical significance in visualizations
- Saving plots in publication-ready formats
- Advanced figure types:
  - Time series with line plots
  - Combining plot types
  - Multivariate visualization with heatmaps
  - Multi-panel figures
- Capstone exercises

### Workshop Materials

- RMarkdown files with code examples and explanations
- Practice exercises with solutions
- Reference images

### Requirements

- Basic knowledge of R programming
